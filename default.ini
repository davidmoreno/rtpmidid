## All announce sections and connect_to can appear several times.

# RTPMIDI announcement requires a firewall rule to allow incoming
# connections on port 5004. If you want to not have an rtpmidi_announce
# section, comment it out or delete it.
# This creates an announced rtpmidi endpoint, and any connection
# will create a new ALSA port.
[rtpmidi_announce]
name={{hostname}}
port=5004

# RTPMIDI discover 
# some rules to just dont accept any announcements. If do not pass the rules, 
# no ALSA port will be created to allow easy connect to the other side.
# name will be "servername:port/service". But as they are regex, just write the
# part you are interested in: for example:
#
#  name_positive_regex=.* # will accept any name
#  name_positive_regex=:5004/ # will accept any at port 5004
#  name_positive_regex=(Peak|Ableton) # will accept only Peak or Ableton, any host any port
#  name_negative_regex=.* # will reject any other name
#
# The check order is:
#  1. First we check the negative regex, if match reject. 
#  2. Then the positive. If match accept.
#  3. If no positive match, reject.
#
# If you really need to reject and accept by name in a serious way, the regex should 
# be complete, with ^ and $. For example:
#
#  name_positive_regex=^(raspberry.local:5004/HYDRASYNTH KB-HYDRASYNTH KB MIDI 1)$
#
[rtpmidi_discover]
# enabled = true|false
enabled=false
# by default negative does nothing
name_negative_regex=^$
# and we accept everything
name_positive_regex=.*

# Alsa announcement requires no firewall as it creates random
# ports for each connection. If you want to not have an alsa_announce
# section, comment it out or delete it.
